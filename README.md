# Life_exp_regression

I created a linear regression model where Life Expectancy is predicted across 19 independent variables.
From there, those 19 variables were cut down to 9 after running various tests such as the Breusch-Pagan, Whites,
and Variance inflation factor. These 9 independents together showed a correlation value of 0.84 when predicting for life expectancy.
